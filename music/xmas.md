With us sing our Savior's birth.

Et l'écho de nos montagnes
Redit ce chant mélodieux

Quel est l'objet de tous ces chants ?

Du libérateur d'Israël
Et pleins de reconnaissance
Chantent en ce jour solennel

Qui l'a vu naître sous ses toits
Offrons-lui le tendre hommage
Et de nos cœurs et de nos voix

Unissez-vous à leurs concerts,
Et que vos tendres musettes
Fassent retentir les airs

Frae morning sun ‘til dine;
But seas between us braid have roared
Sin’ auld lang syne.

And give a hand o’ thine!
And we’ll take a good willie draught,
For auld lang syne.

Capo on 5th fret, sounding key of F

V. 1

Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,
     G7                    C
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.

The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay,
    G7          C       Dm       G7   C
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.

V. 2
The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes.
I love thee, Lord Jesus! look down from the sky,
And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh.

V. 3
Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask thee to stay
Close by me forever, and love me I pray.
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care,
And take us to heaven to live with thee there.

## The First Noël

The first Nowell the angels did say
G      D       A7    D  G     A7  D              A7    D
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
A7 D      Bm    A    Em   D       G        D
In fields where they lay, keeping their sheep,
G    D        A7   D  G  A7   D      A7   D
On a cold winter's night that was so deep:

Refrain
A7 D    Bm  F#m  D  G      D
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell,
Bm      G   D     A7  D  A7 D
Born is the King of Israel.

They looked up and saw a star,
Shining in the east, beyond them far:
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night:

Refrain

Verse 3
And by the light of that same star,
Three Wise Men came from country far;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star whersoever it went:

Refrain

Verse 4
This star drew nigh to the north-west;
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest;
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay:

Refrain

Verse 5
Then entered in those Wise Men three,
Full reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in his presence,
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense:

Refrain

Verse 6
Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made heaven and earth of nought,
And with his blood mankind hath bought:

Refrain

## Frosty the Snowman

```
G                          C           G
Frosty the Snow Man, was a jolly happy soul
       C                   G      Em           Am        D7     G
With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal.
G                          C              G
Frosty the Snow Man, is a fairy tale they say
       C                    G        Em          Am      D7       G
He was made of snow but the children know how he came to life one day.
      C                   Bm7           Am7               G
There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found,
    D                   D7             A              D7
For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around.

Oh, Frosty the Snow Man was alive as he could be,
And the children say he could laugh and play
just the same as you and me.

Frosty the Snow Man knew the sun was hot that day,
So he said, "Let's run and we'll have some fun
now before I melt away.

Down to the village, with a broomstick in his hand,
Running here and there all around the square,
saying "Catch me if you can.

He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop,
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler, "Stop!

Frosty the Snow Man had to hurry on his way,
But he waved good-bye, saying, "Don't you cry;
I'll be back again some day."

While shepherds kept their watching
      D     C      D   G
O’er silent flocks by night,
Behold throughout the heavens,

there shone a holy light.

The shepherds feared and trembled,
When lo! Above the earth,
Rang out the angel chorus

The humble Christ was born,
And Got sent us salvation
That blessed Christmas morn.

## God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen

Verse 1
Em
God rest you merry, gentlemen,
Let nothing you dismay,
For Jesus Christ our Saviour
Was born upon Christmas day,
      Am            Bm7     B7/D#
To save us all from Satan's power
     Em           D/F#
When we were gone astray:

Chorus

O tidings of comfort and joy,

comfort and joy,

O tidings of comfort and joy.

Verse 2
From God our heavenly Father
A blessed angel came,
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same,
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name:
Chorus
 
Verse 3
The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind,
And went to Bethlehem straightway,
This blessed Babe to find:

Chorus

Verse 4
But when to Bethlehem they came,
Whereat this Infant lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His mother Mary kneeling,
Unto the Lord did pray:

Chorus

Verse 5
Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface

Born to give them second Birth.

Come, Desire of Nations, come,
Fix in us thy heav'nly Home;

Bruise in us the Serpent's Head.

Now in Mystic Union join
Thine to Ours, and Ours to Thine.

Adam's Likeness, LORD, efface,
Stamp thy Image in its Place,
Second Adam from above,
Reinstate us in thy Love.

Thee, the Life, the Inner Man:
O! to All Thyself impart,
Form'd in each Believing Heart.

On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;
   D        A/D        D       A/D
I saw three ships come sailing in

And what was in those ships all three,
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day?
And what was in those ships all three,
On Christmas Day in the morning?

V. 3
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there,
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there,
On Christmas Day in the morning.

V. 4
Pray, wither sailed those ships all three,
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;

## It Came Upon a Midnight Clear

```
Play on 3rd fret (key of Eb)

V. 1
   C    F       C
It came upon the midnight clear,
    F         D7      G7
That glorious song of old,
     C      F       C
From angels bending near the earth,
   F           G7       C
To touch their harps of gold:
E7                   Am
"Peace on the earth, goodwill to men,
     G        D7           G
From heaven's all-gracious King."
    C        F      C
The world in solemn stillness lay,
   F        G7     C
To hear the angels sing.

V. 2
Still through the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled,
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world;
Above its sad and lowly plains,
They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o'er its babel sounds
The blessèd angels sing.

V. 3
Yet with the woes of sin and strife
The world has suffered long;
Beneath the angel-strain have rolled
Two thousand years of wrong;
And man, at war with man, hears not
The love-song which they bring;
O hush the noise, ye men of strife,
And hear the angels sing.
 
V. 4
And ye, beneath life's crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow,
Look now! for glad and golden hours
come swiftly on the wing.
O rest beside the weary road,
And hear the angels sing!

V. 5
For lo!, the days are hastening on,
By prophet bards foretold,
When with the ever-circling years
Comes round the age of gold
When peace shall over all the earth
Its ancient splendors fling,
And the whole world give back the song
Which now the angels sing.

## It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas

```
[Verse]
C                        F        C          C          E7  F
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, everywhere you go;
       F                    G    C               Am
Take a look in the five-and-ten, glistening once again
     G               D            G
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow.
     C                   F        C          C       E7    F
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, Toys in every store,
        F                  G          C               Am
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
        F   G     C
On your own front door.

[Bridge]
          Am                   Am
A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
       E                  Am
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
D                                      D
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
       G
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
    G7
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, soon the bells will start,
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart.

## Jingle Bells

```
V. 1
G
Dashing through the snow
                    C
In a one-horse open sleigh
Am                 D7
O'er the fields we go
                 G
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob tail ring
               C
Making spirits bright
     Am           G 
What fun it is to ride and sing
    D7           G
A sleighing song tonight!

Chorus (2x)
D7   G
Oh, Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way.
C               G
Oh! what fun it is to ride
     A7             D7
In a one-horse open sleigh.

V. 2
A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon, Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side,
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank
And then we got upsot.

V. 3
A day or two ago,
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow,
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

V. 4
Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
and sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bobtailed bay

Joy to the world! The Lord is come;

Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare him room,
And heaven and nature sing,
    A7
And heaven and nature sing,

And heaven, and heaven, and nature sing.

Joy to the earth! the savior reigns;
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make his blessings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as, the curse is found.

He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of his righteousness,
And wonders of his love,
And wonders of his love,
And wonders, wonders, of his love.

‘cause I ain’t been nuttin’ but bad.

V. 2
I put a tack on teacher’s chair;
Somebody snitched on me.
I tied a know in Susie’s hair,
Somebody snitched on me.
I did a dance on Mommy’s plants;
Climbed a tree and tore my pants;
Filled the sugar bowl with ants:
Somebody snitched on me.

V. 3
I won’t be seeing Santa Clause;
Somebody snitched on me.
He won’t come visit me because
Somebody snitched on me.
Next year, I’ll be going straight;
Next year I’ll be good—just wait!
I’d start now, but it’s too late;
Somebody snitched on me.

Disperse the gloomy clouds of night

And open wide our heavenly home;
Make safe the way that leads on high,
And close the path to misery.

And order all things, far and nigh;
To us the path of knowledge show,
And cause us in her ways to go.

O Come, Desire of nations, bind
In one the hearts of all mankind;
Bid Thou our sad divisions cease,
And be Thyself our King of peace

In all our trials born to be our friend.

Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another;

And in His name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us praise His holy name.

Christ is the Lord! O praise His Name forever,
His power and glory evermore proclaim.
His power and glory evermore proclaim.

V. 3
Over the river, and through the wood—
oh, how the wind does blow!
It stings the toes and bites the nose
as over the ground we go.

V. 4
Over the river, and through the wood—
and straight through the barnyard gate,
We seem to go extremely slow,
it is so hard to wait!

V. 5
Over the river, and through the wood—
When Grandmother sees us come,
She will say, "O, dear, the children are here,
bring a pie for everyone."

V. 6
Over the river, and through the wood—
now Grandmother's cap I spy!
Hurrah for the fun! Is the pudding done?
Hurrah for the pumpkin pie!
 
V. 7
Over the river, and through the wood,
with a clear blue winter sky,
The dogs do bark, and children hark,
as we go jingling by.

V. 8
Over the river, and through the wood,
to have a first-rate play.
Hear the bells ring, "Ting-a-ling-ding!",
Hurrah for Thanksgiving Day!

V. 9
Over the river, and through the wood,
no matter for winds that blow;
Or if we get the sleigh upset
into a bank of snow

V. 10
Over the river, and through the wood,
to see little John and Ann;
We will kiss them all, and play snow-ball
and stay as long as we can.

V. 11
Over the river, and through the wood,
trot fast, my dapple-gray!
Spring over the ground like a hunting-hound!
For 'tis Thanksgiving Day.

V. 12
Over the river, and through the wood,
Old Jowler hears our bells.
He shakes his pow, with a loud bow-wow,[1]
and thus the news he tells.

Verse 1
Em                B7     Em
We three kings of Orient are;
Em               B7        Em
Bearing gifts we traverse afar,
G         D         G
Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
Am        B+   B Em
Following yonder star.

Chorus
D G              C        G
O star of wonder, star of night,
C               G
Star with royal beauty bright,
         Am  G     C    G     Am     G
Westward leading, still proceeding,
                C       G
Guide us to thy perfect light.

Chorus

Verse 2
Born a King on Bethlehem’s plain
Gold I bring to crown Him again,
King forever, ceasing never,
Over us all to reign.
Chorus
 
Verse 3
Frankincense to offer have I;
Incense owns a Deity nigh;
Prayer and praising, voices raising,
Worshiping God on high.

Chorus

Verse 4
Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume
Breathes a life of gathering gloom;
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,
Sealed in the stone cold tomb.

Chorus

Verse 5
Glorious now behold Him arise;
King and God and sacrifice;
Alleluia!, Alleluia!,
Rings through the earth and skies.

Chorus

## White Christmas

```
G                 Am7   D7
I’m dreaming of a white Christmas,
C             Am     D        G
Just like the ones I used to know.

          G         G7
Where the tree tops glisten,
    C          Cm
And children listen,
   G    Em                  Am     D7
To hear sleigh bells in the snow.
G                 Am7   D7
I’m dreaming of a white Christmas,
C           Am       D      G
With every Christmas card I write.

         G       G7        C       Cm
May your days be merry and bright,
        G   Em   Am   D7        G
And may all your Christmases be white.
