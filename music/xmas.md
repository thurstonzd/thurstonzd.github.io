Em
God rest you merry, gentlemen,
Let nothing you dismay,
For Jesus Christ our Saviour
Was born upon Christmas day,
      Am            Bm7     B7/D#
To save us all from Satan's power
     Em           D/F#

From God our heavenly Father
A blessed angel came,
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same,
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name:
Chorus
 
Verse 3
The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind,
And went to Bethlehem straightway,
This blessed Babe to find:

Chorus

Verse 4
But when to Bethlehem they came,
Whereat this Infant lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His mother Mary kneeling,
Unto the Lord did pray:

Chorus

Verse 5
Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface

O little town of Bethlehem,

How still we see thee lie.
          D7       Gm
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
    F      C7       F
The silent stars go by;

Yet in thy dark streets shineth

The everlasting Light.

The hopes and fears of all the years
    F   Bb  F   C7  F
Are met in thee tonight.

Verse 2
For Christ is born of Mary,
And, gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wond’ring love.
`O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth,
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.

Verse 3
How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is giv'n!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heav'n.
No ear may hear his coming;
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him, still
The dear Christ enters in

Following yonder star.

Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,
Sealed in the stone cold tomb.

King and God and sacrifice;
Alleluia!, Alleluia!,
Rings through the earth and skies.

## It Came Upon a Midnight Clear

```
Play on 3rd fret (key of Eb)

V. 1
   C    F       C
It came upon the midnight clear,
    F         D7      G7
That glorious song of old,
     C      F       C
From angels bending near the earth,
   F           G7       C
To touch their harps of gold:
E7                   Am
"Peace on the earth, goodwill to men,
     G        D7           G
From heaven's all-gracious King."
    C        F      C
The world in solemn stillness lay,
   F        G7     C
To hear the angels sing.

V. 2
Still through the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled,
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world;
Above its sad and lowly plains,
They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o'er its babel sounds
The blessèd angels sing.

V. 3
Yet with the woes of sin and strife
The world has suffered long;
Beneath the angel-strain have rolled
Two thousand years of wrong;
And man, at war with man, hears not
The love-song which they bring;
O hush the noise, ye men of strife,
And hear the angels sing.
 
V. 4
And ye, beneath life's crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow,
Look now! for glad and golden hours
come swiftly on the wing.
O rest beside the weary road,
And hear the angels sing!

V. 5
For lo!, the days are hastening on,
By prophet bards foretold,
When with the ever-circling years
Comes round the age of gold
When peace shall over all the earth
Its ancient splendors fling,
And the whole world give back the song
Which now the angels sing.
```

## Joy to the World

```
D                     Em   A7 D
Joy to the world! The Lord is come;
    G     A           D
Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare him room,
And heaven and nature sing,
    A7
And heaven and nature sing,
    D       G   D       Em  D  A7  D
And heaven, and heaven, and nature sing.

Joy to the earth! the savior reigns;
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make his blessings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as, the curse is found.

He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of his righteousness,
And wonders of his love,
And wonders of his love,
And wonders, wonders, of his love.
```

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
A7 D      Bm    A    Em   D       G        D
In fields where they lay, keeping their sheep,
G    D        A7   D  G  A7   D      A7   D
On a cold winter's night that was so deep:

Refrain
A7 D    Bm  F#m  D  G      D
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell,
Bm      G   D     A7  D  A7 D
Born is the King of Israel.

Verse 2
They looked up and saw a star,
Shining in the east, beyond them far:
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night:

Refrain

Verse 3
And by the light of that same star,
Three Wise Men came from country far;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star whersoever it went:

Refrain

Verse 4
This star drew nigh to the north-west;
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest;
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay:

Refrain

Verse 5
Then entered in those Wise Men three,
Full reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in his presence,
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense:

Refrain

Verse 6
Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made heaven and earth of nought,
And with his blood mankind hath bought:

Refrain

Bought some gum with a penny slug; 
D7                   G
Somebody snitched on me.

Chorus
G
Oh, I’m getting’ nuttin’ for Christmas.
D7
Mommy and Daddy are mad.
G
I’m getting’ nuttin’ for Christmas,
       D7                        G
‘cause I ain’t been nuttin’ but bad.

V. 2
I put a tack on teacher’s chair;
Somebody snitched on me.
I tied a know in Susie’s hair,
Somebody snitched on me.
I did a dance on Mommy’s plants;
Climbed a tree and tore my pants;
Filled the sugar bowl with ants:
Somebody snitched on me.

V. 3
I won’t be seeing Santa Clause;
Somebody snitched on me.
He won’t come visit me because
Somebody snitched on me.
Next year, I’ll be going straight;
Next year I’ll be good—just wait!
I’d start now, but it’s too late;
Somebody snitched on me.

## Jingle Bells

```
V. 1
G
Dashing through the snow
                    C
In a one-horse open sleigh
Am                 D7
O'er the fields we go
                 G
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob tail ring
               C
Making spirits bright
     Am           G 
What fun it is to ride and sing
    D7           G
A sleighing song tonight!

Chorus (2x)
D7   G
Oh, Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way.
C               G
Oh! what fun it is to ride
     A7             D7
In a one-horse open sleigh.

V. 2
A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon, Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side,
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank
And then we got upsot.

V. 3
A day or two ago,
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow,
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

V. 4
Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
and sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bobtailed bay
Two forty as his speed[b]
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

## Over the River and Through the Wood

```
V. 1
C
Over the river, and through the wood,
    F                     C
To Grandfather's house we go;
    Dm7             G7     C         Am
the horse knows the way to carry the sleigh
            D7                G           G7
through the white and drifted snow.

V. 2
C
Over the river, and through the wood,
    F                  C
To Grandfather's house away!
    F        B7/F#    C/G      Dm
We would not stop for doll or top,
     C/G       G7     C
for 'tis Thanksgiving Day.

V. 3
Over the river, and through the wood—
oh, how the wind does blow!
It stings the toes and bites the nose
as over the ground we go.

V. 4
Over the river, and through the wood—
and straight through the barnyard gate,
We seem to go extremely slow,
it is so hard to wait!

V. 5
Over the river, and through the wood—
When Grandmother sees us come,
She will say, "O, dear, the children are here,
bring a pie for everyone."

V. 6
Over the river, and through the wood—
now Grandmother's cap I spy!
Hurrah for the fun! Is the pudding done?
Hurrah for the pumpkin pie!
 
V. 7
Over the river, and through the wood,
with a clear blue winter sky,
The dogs do bark, and children hark,
as we go jingling by.

V. 8
Over the river, and through the wood,
to have a first-rate play.
Hear the bells ring, "Ting-a-ling-ding!",
Hurrah for Thanksgiving Day!

V. 9
Over the river, and through the wood,
no matter for winds that blow;
Or if we get the sleigh upset
into a bank of snow

V. 10
Over the river, and through the wood,
to see little John and Ann;
We will kiss them all, and play snow-ball
and stay as long as we can.

V. 11
Over the river, and through the wood,
trot fast, my dapple-gray!
Spring over the ground like a hunting-hound!
For 'tis Thanksgiving Day.

V. 12
Over the river, and through the wood,
Old Jowler hears our bells.
He shakes his pow, with a loud bow-wow,[1]
and thus the news he tells.

It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth.
                      C             G   G7
Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
           Bm            F7             Bm
Till He appear'd and the soul felt its worth.

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices,
     D7             G
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

O night divine, O night, O night Divine.

Verse 2
Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,
Here come the wise men from the Orient land.
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friend.

Chorus 2
He knows our need, to our weaknesses no stranger,
Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!
Behold your King, Before Him lowly bend!
 
Verse 3
Truly He taught us to love one another;
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother;
And in His name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us praise His holy name.

Chorus 3
Christ is the Lord! O praise His Name forever,
His power and glory evermore proclaim.
His power and glory evermore proclaim.

Frae morning sun ‘til dine;
But seas between us braid have roared
Sin’ auld lang syne.

And there’s a hand, my trusty fiere!
And give a hand o’ thine!
And we’ll take a good willie draught,
For auld lang syne.
