## The Pirates Who Dont Do Anything

```
Chorus
           A			         D
we are the pirates who don't do anything
    	   A		        	 E
we just stay at home, and lie around
 	       A	         D
and if you ask us, to do anything
           E                     A
we'll just tell you, we don't do anything
 
Verse 1
           A
well I've never been to Greenland
           D
and I've never been to Denver
          A                                       E
and I've never buried treasure in ST Louie or ST Paul
           A
and I've never been to Moscow
           D
and I've never been to Tampa
           A                           E
and I've never been to Boston in the fall
 
Chorus
 
           A
and I've never hoist the main sail
           D
and I've never swabbed the poop deck
           A                                                 E
and I've never veered starboard, cause I've never sailed at all
           A
and I've never walked the gang plank
           D
and I've never owned a parrot.
           A                           E
and I've never been to Boston in the fall
 
Chorus
 
       A
I've never plucked a rooster
          D
and I am not too good at ping-pong
                                                       A
and I've never thrown my mashed potatoes up against the wall
           A
and I've never kissed a chipmunk,
           D
and I've never gotten head lice
             A                          E
and I have never been to Boston in the fall
 
           A
and I've never licked a spark-plug
           D
and I've never sniffed a stink bug
           A                         E
and I've never painted Daisies on a big red rubber ball
           A
and I've never bathed in yogurt
        D
and I don't look good in leggings
           A                          E
and I've never been to Boston in the fall
 
Chorus X2
